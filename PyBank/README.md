This program takes a csv file of financial data as input and produces
a statistical report stored to a csv file and printed to the terminal.

The input file must contain a series of months with corresponding profits
and losses. 

The output report includes the total number of months analyzed,
the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the average
of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the greatest
increase and greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire
period.
