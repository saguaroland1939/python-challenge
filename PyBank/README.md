This script takes a csv file of financial data as input and produces
a statistical report stored to a csv file and printed to the terminal.

The input file must be called "budget_data.csv" and located in a folder
called "Resources" within the same folder as this script. The dataset 
should consist of a series of months with corresponding profits
and losses.

The program outputs a new csv file called "banking_results.csv" to the
Analysis folder within the same folder as this script. The report includes
the total number of months analyzed, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses"
over the entire period, the average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over
the entire period, and the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits
(date and amount) over the entire period.
